Betfair! Sorry for the delay in submitting this test.
This test has been completed using vue.js
My apologies, I've found it hard trying to steal some time to complete the test and get it to you. Plus, gaining access to a computer for more than an hour at a time (my laptop died last week). Hopefully you should see evidence of how I would structure a template. With more time I would have liked to have made the modals reusable components and parsed through the relevant properties.

Thanks, Oliver
