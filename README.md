Betfair! Sorry for the delay in submitting this test.
This test has been completed using vue.js
I have found it very hard trying to find time to complete the test and get access to a compuuter for more than an hour at a time. My laptop died last week unfortunately and it's been a nightmare week. Hopefully you should see evidence of how I would structure a sight. With more time I would have liked to have finished the modals and parsed through properties to make it a reusable component.

Thanks, Oliver
